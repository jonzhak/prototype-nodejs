#Placement - where do you want to show the screen from the question above
(when & where do you want to solicit for referrals).
Here’s a list of popular places. You can pick multiple options
-Right after purchase, on order confirmation page
-On my front page, once user signs in
-On a separate referrals page, but put a banner on front page
-On my payments page (popular if you’re offering “avoid paying for this” for a good referral
-..something else? (please describe)

#Is it mandatory that your users sign up/create an account (typical for saas and marketplaces), or do most of your users never log in (typical for ecommerce)?

##If sign in is not mandatory/typical for most, then how do you want us to find out WHO is sending the referral invitation:
-I want you to make a unique link on my site for each of my previous customers, I will send those unique links to them
-I want you to just ask them “what’s your email/name” and then use that response to get the context of who they are

#What should trigger a successful referral? i.e. Bob invites Sally to your site, and Bob and/or Sally gets a reward when Sally accomplish what?

##What’s the trigger?

##And how is this event reflected/tracked in your platform?
i.e. this can be a confirmation page after a purchase or any other page, or if you have a backend, you can also say this is tracked in my backend in this part of the code...this can be ANYTHING but you have to let us know ahead of time what this is going to be and how is this reflected

#How do you want to handle the referral rewards?

##What do you want to give as the reward? Do you have an internal points/credits system?
Pick one of the three options;

-I have my own system in javascript/php/python etc, I want to you connect it to your API endpoint that lets it know which users deserve the reward
-My website builder (CMS) has a REST API that generates discounts/credits for my users (this is the case with shopify for example). If this is the case, please provide us a link to the API’s documentation and your API keys/password. Keep in mind that sometimes you also need to give our app the permission to read and write discount codes
-Manual - give me a convenient dashboard through which I can see who is owed a reward, then I’ll go give the the reward, then I’ll mark them off
